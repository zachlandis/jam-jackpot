# Welcome to Jam Jackpot!
We at Jam-Jackpot love live music and free concert tickets. So our mission is to give people the opportunity to enter giveaways to win free tickets to concerts, nightclubs, music festivals, and other events.

## How It Works
- Create an account.
- Go to the Giveaways tab.
- Click 'Enter Giveaway' on any giveaway you want to enter.
- Complete the steps to submit your entries (you can submit multiple entries or just one. You pick which entries you want to participate in).
- See Your Entries and Your Prizes on your Home page.

## Admins Only
- Create, update, and delete Giveaways on the Admin pannel
- Create, update, and delete Users on the Admin pannel
    - This includes giving users Admin permissions so they can run their own giveaways.
- View entries on the Admin panel (Admins cannot create/update/delete entries)
- Pick winners for giveaways on the Admin pannel. Simply select the 'Pick Winner' button and a winner will be chosen at random. 
    - You can click pick 'Select Winner' again if you don't want to pick the first choice. 
    - Another winner will be chosen at random each time you click the button. 
    - Click 'Final Winner' to finalize the win. This marks them as the winner of the giveaway internally and it will be listed on the user's Home page.

### What to Look Forward to
- More Admin pannel functionality.
- More ways for users to add entries to the giveaways.
- More Home page buttons and levers for Users.
